				<h3>What is "Static File Integrity"?</h3>
				<p>Many websites today are depending on client-side javascript to handle their user's private information.  Client-side javascript can generally be assume safe - but that assumption requires that no outside malicious parties have tampered with the code.  Canary does periodic checks on the integrity of static (ie: javascript) files to make sure they haven't been changed.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<h3>Why did you name it Canary?</h3>
				<p>At first I thougth the idea of a <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/canary_in_a_coal_mine" target="_blank">canary in a coal mine</a> was sort of similar to Canary.  It wasn't a strong releation, so I just planned on using it as a code name.  I then realized I could say things like, "Your site isn't <i>canary</i> secure!!" (pun very much intended).  That made the name permanent.</p>
